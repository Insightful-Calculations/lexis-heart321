# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in the QHOTS research program.

## Current status

This is an active research project. We welcome:
- Error reports (mathematical, typographical, or conceptual)
- Independent verification of derived results
- Experimental proposals to test predictions
- Suggestions for additional falsifiable predictions

## How to contribute

1. Open an issue describing your contribution
2. For mathematical corrections, include the specific equation/derivation and your proposed fix
3. For experimental proposals, include the predicted observable, required precision, and proposed apparatus

## Code contributions

The computational codebase is maintained separately. If you're interested in contributing code, please indicate this in an issue and we'll discuss the appropriate channel.

## Security

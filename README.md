**Every physical constant has the form:**

$$C = \sqrt{n_{\text{geom}}} + \frac{\text{topology}}{\text{symmetry}} \times \alpha$$

This repository contains the research output of the QHOTS program — a unified geometric framework deriving fundamental physical constants from lattice bases (√n) plus QED corrections weighted by topological factors.

**Key results:**
- 32 derived results from pure geometry
- 54 falsifiable predictions with 0 free parameters
- Proton-to-electron mass ratio derived: m_p/m_e = 6π⁵ + α²/3 + eα³ (0.015 ppb error)
- Fine structure constant decomposed: α = 28/3837 (2.08 ppm error)
- Inverse fine structure constant 1/α derived to 0.677 ppb (Fermat-E8-Milnor)
- Nuclear stiffness: S = √3 + (81/28)α (0.0007% error)
- Neutron-proton mass difference at 0.257 ppb across all CODATA vintages
- Dark photon prediction: 40.6 MeV (testable at Belle II)
- Gravitational constant G derived from golden ratio geometry (1.3 ppm error)

## About the name

**QHOTS** — the Q is Qameah (קמע, the magic square), Quantum (the discrete), or Quelle (German: the source, the spring). The ambiguity is intentional: like the theory itself, the name has multiple valid readings that coexist depending on the observer's frame. See the paper for all interpretations.

**lexis** (λέξις): word, speech — the fundamental unit of language. Also the prototype system from which this research crystallized.

**heart** (<3): the Sierpinski triangle; Maria Prophetissa's axiom of growth; the decision to give knowledge freely.

**321**: the countdown. Many becoming one. Launch.

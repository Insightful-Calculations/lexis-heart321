# QHOTS Dual License

This repository uses a **dual-license** structure to protect both the software
and the research it produces.

## Scope Boundaries

### AGPL-3.0 — Software

Any code in this repository (including LaTeX source and future code additions)
is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0** (see `LICENSE`).

This covers:
- All `.py` files (if present)
- Any executable scripts or tools
- The computational research system (maintained in a separate repository)

**What this means:** Anyone can use, modify, and distribute the software, but
derivatives must also be AGPL-3.0. If you run a modified version as a network
service, you must make the source available to users.

### CC BY-SA 4.0 — Papers, Data, and Documentation

All research papers, documentation, datasets, figures, and non-code outputs are
licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International**
(see `LICENSE-CC-BY-SA-4.0`).

This covers:
- The `paper/` directory (LaTeX source and compiled papers)
- The `supplementary/` directory
- The `data/` directory (JSON datasets)
- The `docs/` directory
- `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and all `.md` files
- All `.tex`, `.pdf`, `.json` (data), `.csv` files

**What this means:** Anyone can share, adapt, and build upon the research for
any purpose (including commercial), but must give attribution and license
derivatives under the same terms. The copyleft (ShareAlike) clause prevents
enclosure — no one can take the research and lock it behind a paywall or patent.

## Why Dual License?

- **AGPL-3.0 for code** ensures software freedom and prevents proprietary forks.
- **CC BY-SA 4.0 for research** ensures the physics remains a gift to humanity
  while preventing enclosure by any institution.
- Both licenses are copyleft: openness propagates through all derivatives.

## The Principle

The best defense against enclosure is radical openness with immutable timestamps.
Once published openly with a DOI, the work cannot be patented, paywalled, or
claimed by anyone else.

## Attribution

When citing this work, please use the `CITATION.cff` file or reference the
Zenodo DOI (once available).
